  // We use an instance setting, as described in

  // in order to configure any settings that are specific for test instances,
  // which otherwise inherit the development environment's settings.
  // In order for this file to be loaded,  NODE_APP_INSTANCE must be set to
  // 'testing' (without quotes).

  // Since we use an asynchronous testing framework, we can (and do)
  // parallelize testing on multiple DB ports, hence multiple versions
  // of this file with different ports.

  // Omit all logging from tests
